## RECURSION

### What is a base case in recursion? Why do we need one? Do we always need one?
A base case is a solution to a given problem to build off. If no base case is given, a stack overflow happens.


### What exactly is a Stack Overflow?
when to many recursive calls are made because no base case was given


### Describe direct and indirect recursion
Direct recursive functions call themselves, indirect functions call another function
